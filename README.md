# FileTracker


The file tracker is originally intended (email snippet can be changed for different purpose) to send out notifications for plex users when new content has been added to the Plex Media Server.

Email accounts that are gmail should enable less secure apps. Since this diminishes security, it is strongly recommended a throwaway account is created (aka a new account specifically just for sending out notifications).
